                Hey there! 👋 I am a developer from Assam, India. I began this journey with absolutely no clue but something unexpected occurred—quite unsettling, really—I found myself thoroughly enjoying the ride.
                <br />
                <br />
                Passionate about crafting engaging digital experiences, I've found my niche in the exciting world of Web Development, with a keen focus on Frontend Development. Armed with the MERN stack, Next.js, and MySQL, I've brought various projects to life, all while honing my skills in collaborative teamwork 🤝.
                <br />
                <br />
                Beyond web development,I am deeply interested in core Computer Science fundamentals, including Operating Systems 💻, Database Management 🗃️, and DSA 👨‍💻. But wait I got a cool side too : I love watching anime (WELP I dont think that helps much) , playing video games and Jayson Tatum is my GOAT🍀🏀.

                Recently, I’ve also discovered a passion for photography—it’s been an exciting creative outlet! 📸 If you’re curious, you can check out some of my work on Instagram.
